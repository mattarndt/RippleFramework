# RippleFramework
A simple addition to your html buttons

This was one of the final assignments assigned in my Client Side Scripting for the Web class. The assignment was to create a framework that anybody could
use to add funcitonality to their website. I decided to make mine a simple, but fun effect that you can add to your buttons or divs. When you
click on them, a ripple effect spreads out across the button.

Follow the instructions provided on the index.html site to see how to use this framework.
Add an id to your button or div. In a script tag at the end, call the JS class (Ripple()) and pass in the id of the button or div you want to add the effect to. You may also pass in an integer as the second parameter. This controls the speed. For example: Ripple(ripple1, 250)

Enjoy.

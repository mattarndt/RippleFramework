# RippleFramework
A simple addition to your html buttons

This was one of the final assignments assigned in my Client Side Scripting for the Web class. The assignment was to create a framework that anybody could
use to add funcitonality to their website. I decided to make mine a simple, but fun effect that you can add to your buttons or divs. When you
click on them, a ripple effect spreads out across the button.

Follow the instructions provided on the index.html site to see how to use this framework.

Enjoy.
